# node-chat-app
A simple chat app, just because.


You need to use node.js version 12.x, or possibly lower. Socket.io doesn't seem to work on 4.0 right now- it may be available in the future.

To install, download this git into a directory. From a terminal or command prompt, navigate to the node-chat-app directory, and run:
    
    npm install

After that, run:
    
    node server.js

You should see something like:
    
    Listening.

Then navigate to localhost:3000, and you have a chat app running!

If anything doesn't work, please file an issue for this project on Github.
